KEY ISSUES:

high_freq_energy: 0.0001 (almost ZERO) - no biological sounds!
spectral_flatness: 0.0000 (extremely tonal) - boats/engines
aci: 0.22 (very low) - no complexity
low_freq_energy: 0.51 (dominant) - rumbles/engines

This IS anthropogenic noise (boats) - the labels are actually CORRECT!
Your Perth Canyon data appears to be heavily dominated by boat/ship noise. This is common near shipping lanes.
